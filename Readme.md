#HTTP5203 API project - Find flight information
###N01442368 Ikumi Mine

##Summary
 * This application allows a user to search their flight information which includes airports, airlines, and schedule. A user can search flight information by flight number and available information will be displayed accordingly. If the flight's location information is available, the real-time location of the airplane will be marked on the Google Map.
 * The flight date input is not working yet.
 * All API access keys are included in the code.
 * There is no redirect URIs used.
 * In the future, I would like to implement a function to update an airplane location marker on the map every second.

##Used APIs
 * Aviationstack API 
 * Google Maps JavaScript API
